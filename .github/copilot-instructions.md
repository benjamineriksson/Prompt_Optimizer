# Lyra Prompt Optimizer Project

This project implements a self-contained Lyra Prompt Optimizer addon that interacts with users to collect input, processes it using the DeepSeek API, and presents optimized prompts back to users.

## Project Structure
- **Backend**: Python Flask server with DeepSeek API integration
- **Frontend**: Both browser extension and web app versions
- **Core Features**: 4-D Methodology prompt optimization with BASIC/DETAIL modes

## Development Guidelines
