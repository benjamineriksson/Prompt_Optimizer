## üöÄ Chrome Web Store (Recommended)

### Prerequisites
- Google account
- $5 one-time registration fee
- Completed and tested extension
- Store listing materials

### Step 1: Prepare Your Extension

#### 1.1 Create Icons (Required for Store)
You'll need to create these icon files in `frontend/extension/icons/`:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon32.png` (32x32 pixels)  
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

**Quick icon creation options:**
- **AI Generation**: Use DALL-E, Midjourney, or Canva with prompt: "Simple purple gradient sparkle star icon for browser extension, minimalist design, transparent background"
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or even PowerPoint
- **Icon Libraries**: Find suitable icons on Flaticon, Icons8, or similar

#### 1.2 Update Manifest with Icons
```bash
cd /Users/benjamineriksson/Documents/GitHub/LYRA/frontend/extension
```

Update `manifest.json` to include icons:
```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Lyra Prompt Optimizer",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Optimize your prompts using Lyra's 4-D methodology powered by DeepSeek AI",
  "icons": {
    "16": "icons/icon16.png",
    "32": "icons/icon32.png",
    "48": "icons/icon48.png",

    }
  },
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage"],
  "host_permissions": ["http://localhost:8000/*", "https://api.deepseek.com/*"]
}
```

#### 1.3 Update for Production
Change the API URL in `popup.js` for production:
```javascript
// For production, change to your deployed backend URL
this.apiUrl = 'https://your-backend-domain.com';
// Or keep localhost for development version
```

#### 1.4 Create Package
```bash
cd frontend/extension
zip -r lyra-extension.zip . -x "*.DS_Store" "*.git*" "README.md"
